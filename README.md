# Mark-Twain-Python-Project

This exercise was used to test our knowledge of strings. Given that strings are immutable, how would we design a program to swap the positions of letters? In this code, uses of random, exception cases, and pythonic return statements are displayed. The text file used is also included in this branch. It was obtained from: https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top

This lab was named after Mark Twain for the following quote:

I dnâ€™ot gvie a dman for a man taht can olny sepll a wrod one way. (Mrak Taiwn)

Real: I don't give a damn for a man that can only spell a word one way. (Mark Twain)
